### Payment Management System

A simple payment management system, inspired by PayPal, in the exact language in which the fin-tech giant started out. 

A few classes that are encapsulated for the project: 

1. [Currency]: A custom interface that defines and holds the data about the currency, like the: 
	i. 'currencyCode': The international code used to identify the currency, like for eg. INR for Indian Rupee
	ii. 'currencySymbol': The international symbol used along with the currency like â‚¹ for Indian Rupee
	iii. 'rupeeEquivalent': The present-day Indian Rupee equivalent of the currency
